## Various Ways to Contribute:

## Simple Steps to Get Started:

* If you are new to Github / Git, no need to get intimidated. 
* You can simply contribute by using the Github website UI (User Interface).

1. Fork this repository. This will create your own copy of this repo.
2. Make whatever changes you want (Acc. to the simple rules mentioned below, obviously)
3. Then, make a pull request.
4. Your pull request will be merged after review! Simple! Done ! 
5. Now, repeat !


## File & Folder Naming Guidelines:

* For Data Structures, file names should be of the format: <Language>-<Data Structure>-<Version Number>
  * For eg: Python-singly_linked_list.py
* For Algorithms, file names should be of the format: <Language>-<Data Structure>-<Time Complexity>-<Version Number>
  * For eg: Python-factorial_O(n).py
* Use separate folders for each concept under the Algorithm/ Data Structure directory. Folder name should be in full lowercase. If the algorithm/DS name has multiple words, separate them by underscores. (eg linked_list folder in Data_Structures folder)

## Writing code

* Before you push your changes to GitHub, make sure that your code compiles and runs without any errors or warnings. 
* Currently we are accepting contributions in C, C++, Java, Python and JavaScript.
* Use meaningful variable, method and function names and comments.
* No profanity.
* If you feel you can improve upon an implementation( with regard to coding practices, complexity), then you can submit your code keeping in mind the File Naming Guidelines.
